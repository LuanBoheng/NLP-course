run **[corpus_processing.py](https://github.com/LuanBoheng/NLP-course/blob/master/week_2/corpus_processing.py)** will calclulate ngram frequency as binary files in **[data](https://github.com/LuanBoheng/NLP-course/tree/master/week_2/data)** based of the corpus in **[wiki_corpus](https://github.com/LuanBoheng/NLP-course/tree/master/wiki_corpus)**. and ipython notebook begin with **_doc_** are the documentations.

```shell
pypy3 corpus_processing.py
```





the ngram program is runable. but still has some thing can be enhanced.

```shell
python3 ngram_need_to_be_refactor.py
```





**[debug_tools.py](https://github.com/LuanBoheng/NLP-course/blob/master/week_2/debug_tools.py)** This is a tool which is developed for debug, and measure the time expenditures of specific functions

To start the eliza python program, please run following code in folder **eliza**

```shell
python3 eliza.py
```



about [_doc_linear_regression.ipynb](https://github.com/LuanBoheng/NLP-course/blob/master/week_2/_doc_linear_regression.ipynb) : two important question in machine learning.

1. 是否可以学习
   - 设置 baseline
   - loss 有没有收敛

2. 有没有学习

   - loss 有没有下降
